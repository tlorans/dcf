st.title("Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) Valuation Model")

st.write(r"""

We think about the firm as a "cash processor". 
         
Cash flows into the firm in the form of revenue as it sells it product, and cash flows out as it pays its cashs operating expenses (salaries and taxes, 
         but not interest expense, which is a financing and not an operating expense). The firm takes the cash that is left over and makes 
         short-term net investments in working capital (e.g., invetory and receivables) and long-term investments in property, plant and equipment. 

After these actions, the cash that remains is available to pay out to the firm's investors: bondholders and common shareholders (assuming no preferred stocks). 
That pile of remaining cash is called free cash flow to the firm (FCFF), because it's "free" to be paid out to the firm's investors.

         """)

st.write(r"""
The formal definition of FCFF is the cash available to all of the firm's investors, including stockholders and bonholders, after the firm buys and sells products,
         provides services, pays its cash operating expenses and makes short-term and long-term investments.
         """)


st.write(r"""
With a FCFF valuation model, one can typically choose between a singel-stage, a two-stage, or a three-stage model.
         Single-stage FCFF model is useful for stable firms. Multi-stage models are useful for firms that are expected to grow at different rates in the future.
We use a two-stage FCFF valuation model here.""")

st.write(r"""
A general expression for the two-stage FCFF valuation model is:

- $FCFF_t$ is the free cash flow to the firm in year $t$
- $WACC$ is the weighted average cost of capital
- $g$ is the long-term growth rate of FCFF after year $n$
- $n$ is the number of years in stage 1 (e.g., 5 years)
- $FCFF_{n+1}$ is the free cash flow to the firm in the last year (Year 6 in our case)

st.write(r"""
The Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is the average rate of the reates of return required by each of the capital suppliers to the firm 
(equity and debt holders), where the weights are the proportions of each type of capital in the firm's capital structure.
